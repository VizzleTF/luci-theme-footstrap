# Regenerate i18n/templates/footstrap.pot from the theme sources and merge it into every
# i18n/<lang>/footstrap.po. Run it after adding or changing ANY _('…') string.
#
#   ./update-po.sh            rescan, merge, report what is still untranslated
#   ./update-po.sh --check    change nothing; fail if the .pot is stale or a string is
#                             untranslated. This is the CI gate.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The theme's strings were wrapped in _() from the start, but
# there was no catalogue — and every _() therefore fell through to its English msgid: the
# Appearance popover said "Palette"/"Rounding"/"Cats" on a LuCI running in Russian, and
# nothing anywhere reported a problem. A translation that is never compiled fails silently
# by construction, which is exactly why the --check mode is a gate and not a suggestion.
#
# THE DIRECTORY IS `i18n/`, NOT `po/`, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. luci.mk derives
# LUCI_LANGUAGES from `$(wildcard po/*)` and emits a separate luci-i18n-footstrap-<lang>
# package for each — which is the conventional layout, and which broke the update button for
# every existing install (a release then has several assets, and the self-updater every router
# already runs takes the FIRST .apk by name — the language pack). See the long note in the
# Makefile. The catalogue is compiled into the theme package instead; renaming this directory
# is what stops luci.mk building the language packages.
#
# Nothing here runs on the buildbot: the Makefile calls po2lmo itself. This script is for the
# developer and for CI, and needs perl + gettext (xgettext, msgmerge, msgfmt), none of which
# the OpenWrt build needs.
#
# The scanner is LuCI's OWN build/i18n-scan.pl, not a hand-rolled grep: it knows how to
# lex a .ut template (it rewrites the template into JavaScript before handing it to
# xgettext) and it already covers .js and the rpcd acl.d/*.json titles. A grep for
# _('…') would miss the ACL description and would trip over any apostrophe in a string.
