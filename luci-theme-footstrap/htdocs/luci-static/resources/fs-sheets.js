/* ---- a view's injected CSS: never DELETE it; leave a poisoned document by a real load ----
 *
 * A view's <style> dies with the document on a full load; SPA nav never reloads, so it restyles
 * every page after. `luci-app-filemanager` injects `.cbi-button-apply, .cbi-button-reset,
 * .cbi-button-save:not(.custom-save-button) { display: none !important }` — unlayered + important,
 * outranking every cascade layer: one visit and Save/Reset are gone from every config page.
 *
 * But DELETING them on nav broke SSClash. A poller can be re-registered by re-rendering the view;
 * a stylesheet only returns if its injector runs AGAIN, and a library importing CSS at MODULE EVAL
 * never will (module cached for the life of the document). ACE's ace_editor.css (14 KB of
 * absolutely-positioned layers, gutter, line boxes) is imported once — after the sweep, navigating
 * back to its editor gave a black rectangle 2 007 346 px tall. Deletion was silently one-way.
 *
 * So: a sheet matching only its OWN app's widgets (`.ace_*`, `.cpu-status-view-mode-entry`) is
 * inert elsewhere — LEAVE it. One reaching into the widget universe the THEME styles
 * (`.cbi-button-save`, `pre`, `:root`) can repaint any page: that document is spent, so refuse to
 * hand it to another view and fall back to a REAL page load — speed traded, never correctness, and
 * the fresh document carries no view CSS, so SPA nav resumes right after. That refusal is the SPA
 * router's (fs-router.js) — this module only answers the question.
 *
 * `invasiveSheet()` is that test; its universe is read back from cascade.css itself (same-origin,
 * so `cssRules` is readable) rather than a hand-written list, so it tracks the theme. 0.3 ms per
 * nav. Exempt: `[data-fs-shell]` (the one <style> the server emits — marked, not guessed at) and
 * anything inside `#view` (dies with the content swap); LuCI core injects no <style> at runtime at
 * all (checked: luci.js, ui.js, cbi.js). If cascade.css cannot be read, EVERY view sheet counts as
 * invasive: fail to the slow path, never the broken one. */

/* ---- an invasive sheet still has to render ITS page: re-host it into the theme LAYER ----
 *
 * documentPoisoned() saves every page AFTER this one. It cannot save this one — the sheet is
 * already applying. Every footstrap rule lives in a @layer, and an UNLAYERED normal declaration
 * beats a layered one at any specificity, so a third-party reset owns the chrome outright:
 * `luci-app-openclash` ships `* { margin: 0; padding: 0 }` (a log.htm reset, leaked document-wide
 * by a <link> its Lua template prints into .fs-content). Measured on the router with those two
 * rules and nothing else: menu text flush at x=0 with the icons clipped, submenu indent gone, tabs
 * collapsed to a bare text row. On stock luci-theme-bootstrap — no layers — the same `*` (0,0,0)
 * loses to any class selector on specificity and nobody ever noticed. That asymmetry is the whole
 * bug, and it is ours: the layers are what handed a 0,0,0 selector the win (issue #8).
 *
 * So put the sheet back on specificity footing: re-host it into the EXISTING `theme` layer. Only
 * same-layer arbitrates by specificity — which is exactly what makes bootstrap survive. Measured,
 * all three placements, on the real cascade:
 *
 *   app unlayered (today)        chrome BROKEN   app's own design OK
 *   app -> @layer theme          chrome OK       app's own design OK
 *   app -> @layer before theme   chrome OK       app's own design BROKEN
 *
 * The tempting shape is the third — give the app its own layer under the theme. Do NOT: the theme
 * then beats the app at ANY specificity, including the rules it aims at its own page. OpenClash
 * restyles its tabs with `#tab-header ul.cbi-tabmenu li` (1,1,2) and footstrap styles
 * `ul.cbi-tabmenu li` (0,1,2) — demote the app and footstrap repaints the app author's own tabs.
 * In `theme` the app keeps them, and `*` still loses to the chrome's 0,3,1. No new layer is
 * declared; a re-opened `@layer theme` block appends to the one 00-header.css already names.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT fix: `base`. The app must outrank `theme` for its own page to
 * work, so it sits above `base`, and `*` still wipes base's widget padding (cssdiff: `input`
 * 4px->0, `.ifacebadge`, `strong` margins). That is not a regression — an unlayered `*` beats base
 * today too — it is the price of the same trade, and the only way out would re-break the app.
 *
 * NEVER delete the sheet instead (see dedupeViewSheets below for what that cost). Re-hosting moves
 * where a rule lands in the cascade; every rule still exists, so a library's "did I already import
 * this?" check still finds its sheet. A <link> is DISABLED rather than removed, so an app that
 * looks its own <link> back up by href still finds the element. */
/* ---- the fence: the chrome is ours, so make a foreign rule unable to MATCH it ----
 *
 * Re-hosting into the theme layer settles a fight on specificity. It cannot settle one against
 * `!important`, because importance ranks ABOVE layers — measured: `* { padding: 0 !important }`
 * still owns the chrome after re-hosting, and so does `#indicators { display: none !important }`.
 * The only pure-CSS answer to a foreign flag is our own flag in an earlier layer (it wins — also
 * measured), but that means ~550 of them, and `color`/`background` among them would beat this
 * theme's OWN forced-colors block. Fixing the cascade by breaking high-contrast is not a fix.
 *
 * So do not out-rank the rule — put the chrome where it cannot be addressed. Appending
 * `:where(:not([data-fs-chrome], [data-fs-chrome] *))` to a foreign selector's SUBJECT leaves it
 * matching everything it used to except us. `!important` has nothing left to win.
 *
 * The chrome is NOT one element, and naming one is how this went wrong the first time: the fence
 * said `.fs-sidebar`, which is the menu in both layouts (the bar is the same markup) — but the skip
 * link is a sibling of .fs-shell and the Appearance popover hangs off <body>, so both stayed exposed
 * while every test said the chrome was defended. `data-fs-chrome` is the fix: an element DECLARES
 * that it is ours, where it is written (header.ut, fs-appearance.js), and the fence and the pin
 * follow without being told. A future chrome root cannot forget to edit a constant in this file,
 * because there is no constant naming it any more. `npm run chrome-fence` holds the three together.
 *
 * `:where()` is load-bearing and not cosmetic: it contributes ZERO specificity, so `*` stays 0,0,0
 * and `#indicators` stays 1,0,0 and the app's rules keep their exact weight against each other and
 * against the theme on its own page. A plain `:not(.fs-sidebar)` takes its argument's specificity
 * and would silently re-order the app's stylesheet against itself.
 *
 * Only UNPINNED parts are fenced. A part pinned by the app's own name cannot reach the chrome
 * anyway (proven by the same test invasiveSheet uses), so leaving it alone costs nothing and keeps
 * the surgery as small as the danger.
 *
 * Two silent traps, both measured on the real CSSOM, both of which cost the app its rule:
 *  - A selector LIST must be fenced part by part. Appending to the whole `selectorText` fences only
 *    the last part: `*, ul` came back as `*, ul:where(…)` — `*` unfenced, chrome still exposed.
 *  - A pseudo-element must stay LAST. `a::after` + a tail append serialised to `a::after:where()`
 *    — the argument silently EATEN, leaving an empty `:where()` that matches NOTHING, and the
 *    setter reported success. The fence goes before the pseudo-element: `a:where(…)::after`. */

 * observer collapses the copy in the microtask it appears in. It cannot loop: a removal produces a
 * mutation with no ADDED nodes, and the handler bails unless a stylesheet was added.
 *
 * The immediate pass is not the observer's job and cannot be: a legacy Lua page's <link> is in the
 * SERVER's HTML (openclash prints it into .fs-content), so it is parsed and applying long before
 * this module is even fetched — there is no mutation to observe. It is re-hosted on the first pass
 * instead, which costs a brief flash of unstyled chrome before the modules land; the page then
 * settles correct, where today it stays broken. Runtime injections land in <head> (podkop, banip,
 * adblock, the file manager), which is what the observer watches — deliberately not the whole
 * document, since LuCI's poll rewrites content every second and this would fire on every tick. */

	 * It used to re-host only, which left the server-rendered duplicate — the one case this pass
	 * exists for — uncollapsed for the life of the document. Measured with the real
	 * luci-app-openclash: it prints the same <link href=oc.css> from three templates, so its
	 * Overwrite Settings page carried two identical links and the two @import shims we make for
	 * them, parsing 117 KB of CSS twice. The observer never fires for either: both are in the
	 * SERVER's HTML, so there is no mutation to see. */
