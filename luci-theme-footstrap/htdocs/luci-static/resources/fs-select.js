/* ---- CARD-STACK A DATA TABLE THAT NO LONGER FITS --------------------------------
 *
 * The measuring, the scheduling and the observers are NOT here — they are the shared engine
 * in fs-fit.js, which the top bar's menu uses too. This file supplies only the DECISION.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED. A data table used to be carded by a container query, and there were
 * THREE different thresholds for it: 568 for a plain table (theme/30-tables.css), 780 for
 * the DHCP leases (their 8 nowrap mono columns hold a ~736px floor, so they must card
 * earlier) and 800 for the apk package list. Each of the last two carried its own COPY of
 * the card rules, because CSS cannot share a declaration block across two @container
 * thresholds. Both of those were really asking "does it OVERFLOW?" — a FACT the browser
 * computes — so both are gone: the overflow is measured, each table discovers its own
 * width, and the card rules live once, in theme/30-tables.css, keyed on .fs-stacked. A
 * table from a third-party luci-app-*, whose column count we cannot know, is now handled
 * too.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH. A CONFIG table (.cbi-section-table) keeps its own
 * container query (960, theme/65-dropdown.css). It is NOT measurable: its rows are full of
 * widgets (fs-select turns every <select> into a ui.Dropdown), and a widget bakes in a
 * width from the layout it was laid out in — so un-collapsing it to take a reading changes
 * the very thing being read. Measured on the live router: after that toggle the firewall's
 * zone table reported it needed 1747px where it really needs 1190px, and then overflowed
 * its section by 557px — an overflow the CSS-only version never had. A data table has no
 * widgets, which is exactly why it is the one that gets measured. */
const STACKABLE = '#view .table.fs-dt';

/* "Too cramped to be a table any more" — a DESIGN judgement, and the only number left here.
 * It has to be a number: these tables do NOT overflow when the room runs out, because their
 * cells break anywhere, so the table just compresses into an unreadable ribbon and there is
 * no fact for anyone to read. A config row needs more room than a data row because a
 * dropdown needs more than a text column — which is exactly why its old container query said
 * 960 where the data table's said 568. The values are unchanged; what changed is that there
 * are now TWO of them, in ONE place, instead of five spread across four files.
 *
 * (Do not try to make these measurable by giving the cells a min-width so that "cramped"
 * MANUFACTURES an overflow. That was tried: it carded the firewall's zone table at 1420px
 * and still overflowed by 39px once carded. A floor big enough to force the overflow is a
 * floor big enough to break the card.) */
