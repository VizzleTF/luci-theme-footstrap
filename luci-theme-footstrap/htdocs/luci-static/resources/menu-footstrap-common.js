 * The desktop bar stacks its menu onto a second row only when the menu does NOT fit
 * beside the brand — and whether it fits depends on how many sections THIS ROUTER has,
 * not on how wide the screen is. A stock install renders 5 sections; a box with a few
 * luci-app-* packages renders eleven. So this is measured, not keyed off a breakpoint.
 *
 * It used to be `@media (max-width: 1199px)`. Measured on a stock router the bar's
 * contents come to ~683px (brand 109 + menu 371 + right cluster 155 + gaps), i.e. one
 * row fits down to ~723px — so that breakpoint was stacking the menu on every laptop
 * and throwing away a row of vertical space for nothing.
 *
 * Always measured in the UNSTACKED state: a stacked menu has the whole bar to itself and
 * would of course "fit", which would flip it straight back — the classic layout
 * oscillation. So: unstack → let the density steps try to squeeze it → stack only if even
 * the tightest step still wraps → then let the density relax, now that it owns a row. */
/* ---- does the CONTENT column still have room, once the sidebar has taken its cut? -------
 *
 * The vertical sidebar gives way to the bar when what is LEFT for the content would be too
 * narrow to read. That used to be `@media (max-width: 767px)`, which said nothing about the
 * thing that actually matters — and could not, because the sidebar's cut is not a constant:
 * it is 224px expanded and 68px collapsed to the rail. One viewport breakpoint therefore
 * gave the two states the same answer, when the whole point of collapsing the sidebar is to
 * hand ~156px BACK to the content. So the rail folded away at the same width as the
 * expanded sidebar, and the room it had just freed bought the user nothing.
 *
 * Measured instead: the sidebar's real cut, subtracted from the real viewport. The rail now
 * keeps its column ~156px further down than the expanded sidebar does.
 *
 * The widths are CONSTANTS, not read from the rendered sidebar — deliberately. Reading the
 * live width would make the answer depend on the state it is deciding (once the sidebar is
 * a bar it has no cut at all, so the content "fits", so it un-narrows, so it cuts again):
 * an oscillation. A constant makes the decision a pure function of the viewport. */
/* The numbers come from the STYLESHEET, which is the thing that actually lays the sidebar
 * out — they are not restated here.
 *
 * They used to be: `CONTENT_MIN = 500, SIDEBAR_W = 224, RAIL_W = 68, CONTENT_PAD = 56`,
 * against bare `224px` / `68px` literals in theme/20-shell.css and a `--fs-content-pad`
 * token this file doubled by hand. Two copies of one number, in two languages, with nothing
 * to hold them together: narrow the rail in the CSS and this measurement goes on subtracting
 * the old width, silently deciding the content still fits when it does not — and no gate in
 * the build can see it. (20-shell.css even referred to a "--fs-content-min" token, which did
 * not exist; the value lived only here.) They are tokens now, in 02-tokens.css, and this
 * reads them back.
 *
 * Read once and memoised: fitShell runs on every resize and every content mutation, and
 * getComputedStyle forces a style recalc. The fallbacks are the historical values — a

 * already renders every page client-side into #view (LuCI.view.__init__ →
 * load()→render()); only *navigation* is server-dispatched. So we intercept
 * link clicks, and instead of a full GET we re-instantiate the target view in
 * place — the exact thing the stock dispatcher's view.ut does via
 * ui.instantiateView(), minus the page reload.
 *
 * Safety: this is purely additive theme JS. Anything that is NOT a satisfied
 * `view` node (call/function/template/alias/firstchild, external links,
 * downloads, cross-origin, modified clicks) or any error falls through to a
 * normal browser navigation. Deep links / F5 keep working because we pushState
 * the real dispatcher URL. Other themes are unaffected.
 *
 * Re-instantiation detail: L.require('view.x') returns a cached *singleton*
 * whose __init__ (the render) already ran once, so calling it again won't
 * repaint. We instead grab the class off the instance (Class sets
 * prototype.constructor = the constructor) and `new v.constructor()` to run a

 *
 * _navGen stops a stale require() from calling `new view.constructor()` — but that only
 * covers the CACHED path. On a FIRST visit the require() *is* the render (see the long note
 * in navigate()): LuCI's require constructs the view, and a view's __init__ runs
 * load() → render() → dom.content(#view) and registers its pollers. That construction is
 * already under way inside a promise we do not own; there is nothing to cancel.
 *
 * So the fast double-click is a real bug, not a theoretical one: click Firewall (uncached —
 * module fetch plus its load() RPCs, seconds on a slow router), then click Wireless 100 ms
 * later. navigate(Wireless) flushes L.Poll's queue BEFORE Firewall's poller is ever added.
 * Firewall's load() then resolves, paints into the #view that now belongs to Wireless, and
 * registers its poller — which the flush can no longer catch. The user is left with Wireless
 * in the URL, the title, the menu and body[data-page], Firewall's content on screen, and
 * Firewall's poller running on every page they visit afterwards. Returning quietly on a
 * stale generation left all of that standing.
 *
 * Repair by re-running the navigation that is actually current: navigate() is exactly the
 * "put the document back the way a fresh load leaves it" routine — it flushes the poll
 * queue, kills stray intervals, hides stray modals and re-instantiates the view. push is
 * false: the URL never moved, only the DOM under it did. If it declines (the superseded view
 * injected CSS into <head>), the reload does the same job the hard way.
 *
 * The className check is what terminates this. If the superseded render painted the class the
 * current path wants anyway (click A → B → A while A was still loading), the DOM is correct
 * and its poller is the one this page needs — repairing would re-render for nothing, and with

/* ---- a view's injected CSS: never DELETE it, and leave a poisoned document by a real load ----
 *
 * A view may inject a <style> into <head> at render time. On a full page load that stylesheet is
 * discarded with the document, so it only ever affects the page that asked for it. Our SPA nav
 * never reloads, so it stays in <head> and goes on restyling every page visited afterwards.
 *
 * That is not cosmetic. `luci-app-filemanager` injects
 *     .cbi-button-apply, .cbi-button-reset, .cbi-button-save:not(.custom-save-button)
 *         { display: none !important }
 * (it hides the stock buttons because it has its own), and being UNLAYERED with !important it
 * outranks every cascade layer. Measured on the router: open the file manager once, then go to
 * System → Save and Reset are GONE, and stay gone until a full reload. Any config page touched
 * after visiting that app is unsavable.
 *
 * The router used to answer that by DELETING every injected <style> on nav, alongside the
 * outgoing view's pollers, its stray setIntervals and its open modals. **Deleting CSS does not
 * belong in that family**, and the difference is what broke SSClash. A poller can always be
 * re-registered by re-rendering the view; a stylesheet only comes back if whoever injected it
 * injects it AGAIN — and a library that imports its CSS at MODULE EVAL never will, because its
 * module is cached for the life of the document. ACE is exactly that: `ace_editor.css` (14 KB —
 * the absolutely-positioned layers, the gutter, the line boxes) is imported once per document,
 * while its THEME and MODE sheets ride along with the per-editor lazy-loaded files and do come
 * back. Measured: open SSClash → Configuration, SPA-nav to Log and back, and the editor is a
 * black rectangle with no text — the theme repainted it, the structure never returned — and the
 * unpositioned layers blow the page out to 2 007 346 px tall. Deletion was silently one-way.
 *
 * So the sweep is gone. Two facts decide what replaces it:
 *
 *  1. A sheet that can only match its OWN app's widgets is inert everywhere else. Ace's four
 *     sheets name nothing but `.ace_*` (and `[ace_nocontext]`); the stock overview's CPU include
 *     names `.cpu-status-view-mode-entry`. Left in <head> they restyle exactly nothing on the
 *     next page — so leave them, and ace keeps working across SPA navs.
 *  2. A sheet that reaches into the widget universe the THEME itself styles (`.cbi-button-save`,
 *     `pre`, `:root`, …) can repaint any page — and, being unlayered, outranks every layer. That
 *     document is spent. We cannot delete our way out of it (fact 1's libraries would die), so we
 *     leave it standing and refuse to hand it to another view: the nav falls back to a REAL page
 *     load. The outgoing app keeps the CSS it is still using, the incoming page starts from a
 *     clean document, and the cost is one ordinary navigation — exactly what stock LuCI does on
 *     every link, on every theme. Speed is traded, never correctness, and only on pages that
 *     inject invasively.
 *
 * `invasiveSheet()` is that test, and its universe is not a hand-written list of names: it is
 * read back from cascade.css itself (same-origin, so `cssRules` is readable), so it tracks the
 * theme instead of drifting from it. Two shapes count as invasive — a selector naming a class or
 * id the theme styles, and a selector with no class/id/attribute at all (`pre`, `*`, `:root`),
 * which matches stock markup by construction. Everything else is namespaced to its author.
 * Measured on the router: 0.3 ms per nav, and it correctly splits ace + the CPU include (kept)
 * from the file manager's blob (real load).
 *
 * WHAT IS EXEMPT, and why:
 *  - `[data-fs-shell]` — the ONE <style> the server emits (partials/head.ut). It belongs to the
 *    document, not to a view. Marked server-side rather than guessed at.
 *  - anything inside `#view` — dies with the content swap on its own; it can never outlive the
 *    view, so it can never poison another page.
 *  - LuCI core injects no <style> at runtime at all (checked: luci.js, ui.js, cbi.js), so every
 *    other one in the document came from a view.
 * Self-healing: the full load produces a document with no view CSS in it, so SPA nav resumes
 * immediately after. One slow navigation per poisoned page, not a mode the session gets stuck in.
 *
 * If cascade.css cannot be read at all (no universe), every view sheet counts as invasive — the
 * conservative answer is the slow one, never the broken one. */

	 * catalogue translates the msgid "Top" as "maximum", which is perfectly correct in a
	 * bandwidth dialog and nonsense on a layout switch. Contexting cannot be selective by
	 * string either: whatever we leave bare is a name anyone may take.
	 *
	 * The chrome (Menu, Logout, Skip to content) and the login/notice sentences are
	 * deliberately NOT contexted — they are standard LuCI phrasings, and inheriting a
	 * translation from luci-base is a feature in the ~40 languages this theme has no
	 * catalogue of its own for. The three overview section titles (System/Memory/Storage in
