/* The chrome BOOTSTRAP: load the menu tree once, hand it to the parts that need it, and wire them
 * in the right order. It renders nothing itself — every piece lives in its own module:
 *
 *   fs-menutree    path <-> menu node, alias/firstchild resolution (a port of dispatcher.uc)
 *   fs-prefs       the Appearance axes and their localStorage
 *   fs-widgets     disclosure primitives, the seg/slider controls, popup placement
 *   fs-chrome      mode menu, section tabs, the rail toggle, the "does it still fit" measurements
 *   fs-router      the SPA client router (docs/14)
 *   fs-sheets      the guard against a view's injected CSS repainting every later page
 *   fs-appearance  the popover
 *   fs-update      the version check and the one-click self-update
 *
 * They compose by CALLING each other, never by inheriting: LuCI instantiates every required module
 * into a singleton, so `base.extend` across modules throws and a module cannot subclass another
 * (docs/11 — proven, not assumed). The same constraint is why the MAIN menu arrives as a callback:
 * menu-footstrap.js is the one renderer, and it injects renderMainMenu here rather than overriding
 * a method. LuCI raises DependencyError on a require() cycle, so the graph above is a DAG by
 * construction — the shared halves (fs-menutree, fs-prefs) were pulled out precisely so that no two
 * modules have to reach across into each other. */
