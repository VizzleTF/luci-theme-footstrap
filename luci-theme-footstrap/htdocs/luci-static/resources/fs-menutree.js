 * stamps the RESOLVED leaf into requestpath/dispatchpath/nodespec, keeping `pathinfo` as requested.
 * The client must resolve EXACTLY as dispatcher.uc does, or a click and an F5 on the same URL would
 * open different pages — nodeWeight() and firstChildOf() are ports, not approximations. Only the
 * ACL check is skipped: the tree from /admin/menu is already ACL-filtered for this session.
 *

 * semantics would silently open the WRONG page — worse than the full load it falls back to. */
