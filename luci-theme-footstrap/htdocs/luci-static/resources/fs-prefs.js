 * persisted in localStorage — no server, no reload — and head.ut's inline script re-applies them
 * before paint, so a reload never flashes the wrong one; tools/axes.mjs holds those two copies to
 * one contract, and it derives that contract from THIS file.
 *
 * ---- three layers, and the browser always wins ----
 * The effective value of every axis is  localStorage ?? router-default ?? built-in.  The router
 * default is Appearance -> Save as default (saveAsDefault below, written to /etc/config/footstrap
 * and read back by the server into window.__fsSD); the built-in is a bare :root. So a NEW browser,
 * incognito, or a cleared cache inherits the router default, but THIS browser's own choice — stored
 * EXPLICITLY, see the next paragraph — overrides it, in either direction.
 *
 * ---- every applier stores its choice EXPLICITLY, and that is load-bearing ----
 * Once a router default exists, "clear the key" no longer means "the built-in default" — it means
 * "inherit whatever the router default is". So an applier that lsDel-ed on the default value could
 * not express "I want the built-in, NOT the router default" (you could not turn a router-defaulted
 * tint back off). Every axis therefore records the chosen value, including the off/default one, the
 * way `layout` always has. lsDel is reserved for resetToDefault(), which drops back to the router
 * default on purpose. */

/* ---- the three dialects are PUBLISHED, so third parties write them too ----
 *
 * Announcing dark mode in a vocabulary apps understand is what makes them follow the page — and it
 * is exactly why an app reaches for the same attribute. `luci-app-openclash` stamps
 * `data-darkmode="true"` straight onto :root from seven of its templates (config_editor.htm:215,306,
 * select_git_cdn.htm:114, config_edit.htm:259, tblsection.htm:479, sub_info_show.htm:52), gated on
 * its own isDarkBackground() (openclash/js/common.js:12) — which consults
 * `matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` BEFORE it ever looks at the body's real background.
 *
 * So a user who explicitly chose LIGHT here, on an OS set to dark, gets the whole theme flipped to
 * dark by opening an OpenClash page. Reproduced on the router: data-darkmode false -> true, page
 * background rgb(246,248,250) -> rgb(28,33,40). Their explicit choice, lost, silently, to their OS
 * setting, through someone else's package. select_git_cdn.htm:117's removeAttribute is the mirror
 * hazard: it deletes the attribute head.ut writes as 'false'.
 *
 * No cascade trick can answer this — it is a DOM write, not a rule. So watch the attributes we own
 * and restate the truth. Nothing else is guarded: the other axes (data-layout, data-palette,
 * data-accent, data-tint) are PRIVATE to this theme, no app has a reason to know them, and a survey
 * of ten shipping packages found none that writes any of them. The published trio is the surface
 * precisely because it is published.
 *
 * This does not fight the app's intent, it corrects a wrong premise: when the page really is dark,
 * OpenClash's write AGREES with ours and the guard never fires — the compare is what makes it inert
 * in the common case, and what stops it looping on its own restamp. It also cannot ping-pong: our
 * write produces a mutation, the callback re-runs, the values now match, it returns. */

 * `def()` is the router default alone, `apply()` stores the choice EXPLICITLY (see the header —
 * lsDel would mean "inherit the router default", which is not what picking the built-in means).
 * Neither uses `this`: every export below is a DETACHED method reference (`const currentTint =
 * TINT.current`), and a `this` in here would throw the moment one was called.
 *
 * The router-default fallback keys off the axis name (`fs-tint` -> window.__fsSD.tint), so both
 * helpers take their key as the FIRST argument and tools/axes.mjs matches each call by its literal
 * args — that scan is how a key reaches the gate at all, since an axis built by a factory has no
 * lsGet('fs-…') call site to find.
 *
 * The other FIVE axes stay separate; each has a quirk a shared table would need an option for.
 * `mode` stores a value it does not apply (tri-state → matchMedia) and owns an MQL listener;
 * `radius` sets an inline property with no attribute; `layout` reads the ATTRIBUTE (the
 * server-migrated default); `autoCollapse`/`updateCheck` have no :root attribute at all. */
