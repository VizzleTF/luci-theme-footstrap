# Footstrap theme self-update.
#
# Downloads the latest GitHub release package for THIS theme and installs it with apk (25.12+)
# or opkg (24.10). Repo and API endpoint are hard-coded and only fixed keywords are accepted, so
# the ACL-gated LuCI `file.exec` that triggers it has no injection surface.
#
# But note WHAT the ACL gates: file.exec matches the command PATH only — `params` and `env` are
# the caller's. So the keyword is not limited to the two the client sends (`__run` is the
# privileged worker entrypoint — see that branch), and the environment is not ours either: PATH
# and the loader variables are pinned below, because LD_PRELOAD on /bin/sh is code execution as
# root for anyone holding this ACL.
#
# WHY IT DAEMONISES. The install outlives both RPC timeouts — rpc.js aborts the XHR after
# `rpctimeout` (20 s), rpcd kills the exec'd process after `rpcd.@rpcd[0].timeout` (30 s) — so a
# synchronous run reported "XHR request timed out" even when it succeeded, and rpcd could kill
# apk mid-install. The foreground call only spawns a detached worker; the client polls `status`.
#
# Protocol (stdout, one line):
#   <no args>  -> STARTED | RUNNING            (spawn worker / already running)
#   status     -> RUNNING | OK | ERR: <reason> | IDLE
#   check      -> v<tag> | ERR: <reason>       (latest release, cached)
# The client reads the KEYWORD, not the exit code: `check` exits 1 when the API is unreachable, and
# an unknown argument exits 1, while the rest exit 0.

# The CALLER sets this process's environment (above), so nothing may be resolved through an
# inherited PATH — nor through the dynamic loader, which PATH does not cover: /bin/sh is not
# setuid, so it honours LD_PRELOAD/LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and this ACL becomes arbitrary code as root.
# The proxy variables go too: they would redirect the fetch through a host of the caller's choosing.

# The release public key, shipped BY THIS PACKAGE. Read from disk rather than embedded, so the
# key travels with the code that trusts it: a key rotation is then one file in one release, and
# the router that installs that release is the one that starts trusting the new key. install.sh
# is the one place that has to carry a second copy — it runs from `curl | sh`, before any package
# exists — and CI fails if the two ever differ.
PUBKEY=/usr/share/luci-theme-footstrap/release.pub

# fetch <url> <max-seconds> [outfile]   — stdout when no outfile.
#
# curl is NOT on a stock OpenWrt router — the base image ships `uclient-fetch`, curl is a
# separately-installed package (dev router: `/usr/bin/curl is owned by curl-8.19.0-r2`). This
# script hard-required it, so on a stock router BOTH the update badge and the Update button died
# with "ERR: cannot reach the GitHub release API" (reproduced by moving /usr/bin/curl aside).
# Falling back keeps the theme's dep list at +luci-base.
#
# Every fetch is BOUNDED: without a timeout a stalled connection leaves STATUS=RUNNING and a live
# $WORKER behind forever — what the "" branch reads as "a run is in progress" — so the button
# wedges until a reboot.
#
# The certificate is always verified. Never add a `-k` / `--no-check-certificate` fallback: a failed
# verification IS the MITM case, and ca-bundle is in OpenWrt's DEFAULT_PACKAGES, so the insecure path
# buys nothing.
#
# BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT SURVIVES A REDIRECT, because the asset genuinely hops to
# objects.githubusercontent.com and -L has to follow it:
#   - the scheme pin (--proto-redir '=https') exists ONLY on the curl branch. uclient-fetch is tried
#     FIRST and is the only downloader on a stock router (curl is not in the default package set —
#     that is why this fallback chain exists at all), and it has no such flag: it follows up to 10
#     redirects, and an absolute Location: is re-parsed from scratch, so http:// would be followed.
#   - asset_host_ok() pins the host of the INITIAL request only; no backend pins the host across a
#     redirect, and -L is cross-host by design.
# So on the path a stock router actually takes, the ed25519 signature checked below is the ONE layer
# that survives a redirect. That is sound — it is what makes the package trustworthy, and the package
# manager installs --allow-untrusted regardless (it holds no key of ours) — but do not read this
# channel as more than "a verified-certificate delivery of the release metadata".

# TWO checks, and they answer DIFFERENT attackers:
#
#  - the ed25519 SIGNATURE is the real one. The sha256 below cannot stand alone, and the reason
#    is specific: GitHub COMPUTES `@.assets[*].digest` from the bytes that were uploaded. Anyone
#    who can replace a release asset — a leaked PAT with write scope, no CI run needed — gets the
#    digest recomputed for them, and the checksum then verifies the attacker's package happily.
#    The signing key is not in the repository and cannot be read back out of GitHub, so a
#    replaced asset fails here.
#  - the sha256 still earns its place: it catches a tampered or TRUNCATED download from the asset
#    CDN (objects.githubusercontent.com — a different host from api.github.com) with a clearer
#    failure than a signature mismatch. It does NOT survive usign's absence — nothing does: a
#    missing usign is rc=2 below and refuses, which is the correct behaviour and the opposite of
#    what this comment used to promise.
#
# Both fail CLOSED. A missing digest, a missing .sig asset, no usign on the box: all refuse. The
# `if [ -n "$digest" ]` shape this once had fails OPEN — a renamed field, a predicate that stops
# resolving, an absent tool, all leave the variable empty, and it installed with no integrity
# check at all while reporting OK. Bytes we cannot account for, we do not hand to root.
