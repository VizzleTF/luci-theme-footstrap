## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **The sidebar/top-bar layout is now an instant toggle in Appearance → Layout, remembered per browser.** It
  used to be a *server* choice: two theme entries in System → Design (`FootstrapSidebar`,
  `FootstrapOnTop`), each with its own `mediaurlbase`, its own template directory and its own menu
  renderer. Switching meant going through the Design page and reloading. It is now a client
  preference like dark mode — `:root[data-layout]`, pre-painted by `head.ut` before the first frame,
  so there is no flash — and switching repaints in place with **no page reload and no menu re-render**:
  the DOM already serves both, and the menu's existing `MutationObserver` folds the accordion into
  dropdowns (and restores it on the way back) because that is the same state change as collapsing the
  icon rail.

- **Three new CSS gates, each closing a hole nothing off-the-shelf covers** (`npm run check` runs the
  lot; all three are CI-only — the OpenWrt buildbot still needs nothing but `cat`).
  - `tools/css-dup.mjs` — **the same declaration body written under two different guards, plus the
    `@mirror` contract that makes the unavoidable copies incapable of rotting.** No linter can flag
    this duplication and none ever will: to a cascade-aware tool two rules under mutually-exclusive
    guards (a media query vs an attribute selector, two `@container` thresholds) are both *required*,
    since only one can ever match. Yet it is exactly the shape that drifts — this release removed 55
    such declarations, and the detector then found a cluster nobody had noticed: the data-table card
    stack is written **three times** (~41 redundant declarations), because it has to fire at 568px for
    a normal table but at 780px for the DHCP leases, whose 8 nowrap mono columns hold a ~736px floor.
    That one is **not removable** — hoisting the stack to the wider threshold and un-stacking the
    narrower tables in the gap merely trades a copy for a *reset*, which is the same two-place coupling
    in a form that is harder to reason about. So the copies stay and are **pinned**: every one carries
    a `/* @mirror <group>/<role> */` tag, and the tool fails if they ever stop being byte-identical.
    This closes the trap the detector walks into on its own — it finds bodies that are IDENTICAL, so
    the moment two copies diverge they stop being a "duplicate" and it would go quiet *exactly when you
    need it to shout*. There is no numeric budget: every duplicate must be folded or pinned, because a
    budget is a number nobody defends and it lets the next unexplained copy in for free.
  - `tools/fs-orphans.mjs` — **dead CSS, scoped to the `fs-*` namespace.** PurgeCSS/uncss and
    coverage-based pruning are actively dangerous here: the coverage contract exists *because* a
    third-party `luci-app-*` renders widgets no page we can see renders, and a tool that prunes what
    it did not observe will un-theme somebody's app. But nobody else can emit an `fs-` class — so
    inside that one namespace, "nothing we ship emits it" really does mean dead, with zero risk to the
    contract. This is the check that catches a selector left behind when its markup is deleted.
  - `tools/css-metrics.mjs` — a **ratchet** on `!important` (33: the 16 in theme/pages that fight an
    inline or unlayered declaration, plus base's 17), max specificity and empty rules. `stylelint`
    stops a *new* file adding an `!important`; this stops the allowlisted files quietly growing more.

### Changed
- **Design now lists ONE "Footstrap" theme instead of two.** `mediaurlbase` is always
  `/luci-static/footstrap`; the layout is no longer a server-side theme at all. A router that was on
  the old top-nav theme keeps its top bar: `uci-defaults` records it as the router's default layout
  (`luci.main.footstrap_layout=top`), which `head.ut` stamps onto `<html data-layout>` — so a
  *migrated router opens on the top bar even in a browser that has never seen it*, and the user's own
  choice (localStorage) overrides that default forever after. A shell script cannot write
  localStorage; this is the channel that carries the fact across the upgrade.
- **`data-layout` is always stamped with an explicit value, by the server.** Absent-means-sidebar
  would force every rule to be a *negative* match (`:not([data-layout="top"])`), and a future third
  layout would then silently inherit the sidebar's rules merely by not being "top". Every layout rule
  is a positive match instead, so a new layout has to opt in. It also means the chrome is correct with
  JavaScript disabled — the attribute exists before a single byte of script runs.
- **On a phone, every layout renders the same top bar.** The sidebar's phone bar and the top layout's
  bar are one look now, so a narrow screen shows the same chrome whichever layout is picked. Where the
  two layouts had ever disagreed on the same element, the top bar's value is the one that survived.
- **The top bar's "Log out" is the same control as the sidebar's** — a square icon button in the right
  cluster, not a separate text item in the menu. The menu renderer already dropped the tree's
  `admin/logout` node in favour of the theme's own control; the top layout used to carry both.
- **The bar is now written once, and the vertical sidebar is the exception.** The bar is needed when
  `(viewport ≤ 767px) OR (:root[data-layout="top"])`, and CSS cannot OR a media query with an
  attribute selector in one selector — so writing the bar under both guards meant writing it twice.
  Measured: **55 of ~75 declarations were identical**, i.e. free to drift apart in silence. Inverting
  it — the bar as the unguarded base, the vertical sidebar as a single guarded override that wins on
  specificity (`0,3,0` vs `0,1,0`), never on source order — states each of the three chrome states
  exactly once. This is only expressible because `data-layout` always carries an explicit value.
  `cssdiff` proves the desktop sidebar is byte-identical across 3 014 elements.
- **The bar stacks its menu onto a second row only when the menu does not fit — measured, not guessed.**
  It used to be `@media (max-width: 1199px)`. But whether the menu fits beside the brand depends on how
  many sections the router HAS (a stock install renders 5; a box with a few `luci-app-*` renders eleven),
  so a device-width breakpoint is the wrong instrument. Measured on a stock router the bar's contents come
  to ~683 px, so one row fits down to ~723 px — **that breakpoint was stacking the menu on every laptop and
  throwing away a row of vertical space for nothing**. The menu now shrinks its pills first
  (`.fs-dense1/2`) and stacks only when even the tightest step still wraps: at 1000 px a stock 5-section
  menu never stacks, 11 sections shrink, and 13+ stack.

- **One measuring engine (`fs-fit.js`) for every "does it still fit?" decision.** Two places in the
  theme must decide something no CSS query can ask, because the answer depends on what the CONTENT
  needs rather than on how wide the screen is: whether the menu fits beside the brand, and whether a
  table can still be read as a table. Both were once breakpoints, and every one of those numbers was a
  guess that some real router got wrong. The shape of the answer is always the same — measure the
  element UNCOLLAPSED, then toggle a class — so the measuring, the frame-coalescing and the
  ResizeObserver live in one module and a caller supplies only the decision. It encodes three rules,
  each a bug that was actually hit: measure uncollapsed (a collapsed thing always "fits", so reading
  it as it stands un-collapses it and the next frame collapses it again — oscillation); re-fit
  **synchronously** on a mutation (a MutationObserver callback is a microtask and runs *before* the
  frame is painted, whereas `requestAnimationFrame` runs *at* paint — deferring it let a stacked table
  paint one frame at full width and overflow its section on every poll tick, measured at 19–109 px,
  once a second); and coalesce on resize.

- **The sidebar gives way to the bar when the CONTENT column would get too narrow — and the icon rail
  therefore holds on ~155 px longer than the expanded sidebar.** It used to be one viewport
  breakpoint (767 px) for both, which could not be right: the sidebar's cut is not a constant, it is
  224 px expanded and 68 px as a rail. So collapsing the sidebar handed ~156 px back to the content
  and then folded the whole thing away at exactly the same window width — the room it had just freed
  bought the user nothing. The decision is measured from the sidebar's real cut against a stated
  minimum (500 px of content), so the expanded sidebar now yields at ~780 px and the rail at ~625 px.

### Fixed
- **A page with nothing to poll (Software, Backup…) showed a "Paused" pill, reporting on a poll that
  does not exist there.** LuCI shows the indicator on a `poll-start` event and flips it to "Paused" on
  `poll-stop` — and never hides it again (`ui.hideIndicator()` exists, but core only calls it for
  `uci-changes`). On a full page load that omission is invisible, because `Poll.start()` only
  dispatches `poll-start` when the queue is non-empty, so an unpolled page simply never grows an
  indicator. But this theme's SPA router flushes the queue and calls `stop()` on every navigation, and
  `stop()` *does* dispatch `poll-stop`. The pill now obeys the only rule that makes sense — it exists
  if and only if there is something to poll — so it disappears on an unpolled page and comes back on a
  polled one. A **manual** pause still shows "Paused", because there the queue is not empty and the
  word means something. This also cures the same ghost in stock LuCI, where removing the last poller
  stops the loop and leaves the pill behind.
- **Collapsing the sidebar into the icon rail and then shrinking the window made the sidebar spring
  back OPEN, and toggling it again dropped straight to the phone bar.** The rail's rules were guarded
  at `min-width: 768px` while the vertical sidebar's guard had moved to 521 px, so in the gap between
  them the vertical rules applied and the rail's did not — the sidebar expanded to its full 224 px as
  the window got *smaller*. The rail is a MODE of the vertical sidebar and can never be visible under
  conditions the vertical sidebar is not; the two guards are now literally the same.
- **The rail's "Refreshing" glyph could not be clicked to pause the poll — because it was spinning.**
  A target that never stops moving cannot be hit. It is now a still green glyph, which is also what it
  should have been: a spinner promises that something is happening *that you are waiting for*, while
  this is a poll ticking quietly in the background forever, and a permanently spinning icon in the
  corner of the eye just makes an idle router look busy. Pausing and resuming by click both work; and
  the glyph now goes grey when the poll is paused, instead of shining green while lying about it.
- **The "Refreshing" pill drifted away from the Appearance and Log out buttons in the bar** instead of
  hugging them. Both it and the buttons carried `margin-left: auto`, and two autos SPLIT the free
  space between them rather than pushing one cluster to the right edge.
- **The chevrons came back on the collapsed rail's menu items.** A rail item has no label and no
  accordion — its children fly out to the side — so the chevron says nothing and only crowds the icon.
  The rail's rule to hide it was (0,4,0) and lost to the vertical sidebar's (0,4,3), which turns it
  back on.
- **The apk Software package list stopped collapsing into rows and overflowed its section.** It is
  `<table class="table" id="packages">` — no `.cbi-section-table` class at all — and its header row is
  `.cbi-section-table-titles`, not the `.table-titles` the data-table tagger looked for. So it matched
  *neither* rule and needed a hand-written stacking block of its own, at a fifth breakpoint. The
  tagger now accepts either header markup, and the list card-stacks and un-stacks like every other
  data table.
- **A data table now becomes cards when it actually stops fitting, not when the viewport crosses a
  number.** It used to be a container query, and there were THREE thresholds for it — 568 for a plain
  table, 780 for the DHCP leases (their 8 nowrap mono columns hold a ~736 px floor, so they must card
  earlier) and 800 for the package list — with the last two each carrying their own **copy** of the
  card rules, because CSS cannot share a declaration block across two `@container` thresholds. Both of
  those were really asking *does it overflow?*, which is a **fact the browser computes**, so both are
  gone: the overflow is measured and each table discovers its own width — including a table from a
  third-party `luci-app-*`, whose column count we could never have guessed. The card rules now exist
  once. What survives is the one judgement a measurement cannot make ("too cramped to be a table at
  all", 568), and it sits beside the measurement rather than in the stylesheet.
- **A long hostname wraps instead of being silently truncated.** It was `nowrap` + ellipsis, which hid
  the one string that tells you WHICH router you are looking at. It now breaks across lines —
  `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, so it will break mid-word when a single "word" is itself wider than the box,
  but only when there is no better break, so a normal dotted name still breaks at its dots. Wrapping
  alone was not enough: the bar is flex-wrap, so instead of squeezing the brand, flexbox happily wrapped
  the *menu* away and let a 78-character hostname sit on its own line 609 px wide. The brand is therefore
  also **capped** (30ch), and the bar grows in height to hold the extra line.

### Removed
- **The second menu renderer, the second template and the second stylesheet are gone**
  (`menu-footstrap-top.js`, `ucode/template/themes/footstrap-top/`, the `/luci-static/footstrap-top`
  symlink, `styles/theme/50-topnav.css`). They were never two designs — the sidebar renderer already
  emitted the markup that its own CSS turns into a horizontal bar on a phone, and it already had a
  "flyout mode" in which a section behaves exactly like a top-nav dropdown. The top layout is that
  mode, at desktop width: **the whole of the deleted renderer's unique logic was one function**
  (`clampDropdown`, which nudges a dropdown back inside the viewport near the right edge), and it now
  lives in the surviving renderer. Hover-to-open was always pure CSS. Net cost of gaining a
  live-switchable layout: **+78 bytes of CSS**.
- **The `with_label` template parameter and the elements it forked** (`.fs-appearance-btn`,
  `.fs-top-logout`). A layout is a presentation choice, so it must not fork the markup: Appearance and
  Log out are one row each, and the bar and the rail squash them into icon buttons in CSS.

## [0.7.18] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **An Accent hue slider (Appearance → Accent) recolours the UI accent.** A second hue
  axis beside the background Tint, but pointed at the CHROME rather than the canvas: the
  solid buttons, the toggle knobs, the range sliders, the focus rings, the active
  menu/tab and the accented links all follow, because each reads `--fs-accent` or a
  `color-mix()` of it, and the brand logo rotates with it too. The rotation is
  `oklch(from … l c H)` — it keeps the palette's exact lightness and chroma and swaps
  only the hue, so `--fs-on-accent` stays legible on every hue (the ink is not
  recomputed). 0 = off = the palette's designed accent; the value is per-router
  (localStorage) and pre-painted by `head.ut` so a reload doesn't flash the default.

### Changed
- **The page footer ("Powered by LuCI…") is centred** instead of left-aligned, in both
  layouts.
- **A tagged release now leads with a short changelog summary instead of install
  boilerplate.** The release body was just apk/ipk commands — the actual list of
  changes lived only in the changelog nobody links from the release page. It is now
  generated from the tag's `CHANGELOG.md` section (`tools/release-notes.sh`): one line
  per change — the bold lead of each bullet, grouped under Fixed/Added/…, with the
  verbose rationale dropped — and the install commands moved into a collapsed block. The
  Russian summary (from `CHANGELOG_ru.md`) follows the English one under a divider, so the
  release page carries both languages.

### Fixed
- **A scrolling textarea's scrollbar overshot the field's rounded corners.** A native
  scrollbar is a square strip that `border-radius` does not clip, so on a tall config field
  (an NFQWS_OPT blob, a long option list) the grey bar poked past the top-/bottom-right
  corner as a square notch. The scrollbar is now a slim self-rounded thumb floated off the
  edges (a transparent border + `background-clip:padding-box` insets it, a transparent track
  lets the corner show through), via a `::-webkit-scrollbar` block. Deliberately no
  `scrollbar-width`/`scrollbar-color`: setting either makes Chromium switch to the standard
  scrollbar and ignore the custom one — and that standard bar is the square, unclipped one
  that caused the bug. Firefox keeps its native scrollbar, which it already clips to the
  radius. The resize grip is restyled to match: an accent arc tracing the frame's own
  rounded corner (following the Rounding setting and the accent hue) instead of the default
  white square that poked past it. The widget gallery gained a scrolling-textarea case so
  this stays covered.
- **The "Refreshing" poll pill sat at the far left of the phone top bar, before the logo.**
  On a phone the sidebar collapses into a top bar, but `#indicators` had no flex `order`, so
  it defaulted to 0 and rendered ahead of the brand (`order:1`). It now joins the right-hand
  cluster with Appearance and Logout (`order:2` + `margin-left:auto`), mirroring the top-nav
  layout's `.fs-topnav-right` where the pill is the first child.
- **A stacked data table's last row had square bottom corners against the rounded frame.**
  When a data table cards into label/value pairs on a narrow screen, zebra striping
  (`.cbi-rowstyle-2`) paints its background on the row itself, and the frame is
  `overflow:visible` — so a striped last row's square background overshot the 12px rounded
  corners. Stacked rows are flex-wrap and already fit the width (nothing horizontal left to
  clip, the only thing `overflow:visible` guarded), so the table is `overflow:hidden` while
  stacked, clipping the row backgrounds to the frame radius exactly as an ordinary `.table`
  does.
- **The last row of a data table drew a separator that poked out past the card's rounded
  corners.** The row-separator rule (`.tr:not(.table-titles):not(...)`, specificity 0,4,0)
  outranked the `.tr:last-child` override that was meant to drop it (0,3,0), so the last
  row kept its `border-bottom` — a straight 1px line that overshot the frame's rounded
  bottom corners on any `overflow:visible` data table (leases, wifi, processes). The
  exclusion now lives in the separator rule itself (`:not(:last-child)`), so the last row
  never gets the border and no specificity battle decides it. Invisible before only where
  the table was `overflow:hidden` and clipped the line.
- **The DHCP leases table stopped shrinking at ~736px and spilled out of its section.**
  The leases costyl kept every mono column (IPv4/MAC/IAID/Remaining/the Static-Lease
  button/Interface) on one line — `white-space: nowrap` — down to a 568px container, so
  the table held a data-dependent intrinsic floor (~736px on a busy router). But the
  card-stack that folds a data table into label/value pairs only kicked in below 568px,
  leaving a 569–780px dead band where the table could neither shrink nor stack and
  overflowed the card. The `.leases`/`.leases6` pair now stacks from 780px down —
  matching stock bootstrap, which switches its tables to the phone layout early rather
  than forcing a scroll — while nowrap only stays on at ≥781px, where the real table
  genuinely fits. The two thresholds are adjacent (780/781) so no width is left with
  neither behaviour. Other data tables (Processes/Startup/Routes) are narrower and keep
  the shared 568px threshold.

## [0.7.17] — 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **A dialog on a phone laid its form out as if it were a desktop, and cut the inputs
  off at its right edge.** Every mobile rule in the theme was scoped to `#view`, and
  `ui.js` appends a modal to `<body>`, so none of them ever reached it. The
  `@container` queries that stack tables resolved to nothing in there either, because
  a modal sits inside no container the theme names. The modal is now a container in
  its own right (`fs-view fs-content`), and the field-stacking rules no longer ask for
  `#view`. Any app's dialog stacks the way its page does, not just the dialogs we
  happened to test.
- **The theme ignored the phone contract that every `luci-app-*` is written against.**
  LuCI's own JS marks the cells it wants dropped on a phone with `.hide-xs`/`.hide-sm`
  and weights columns with `.col-1`…`.col-10` (`wireless.js`, `connections.js`,
  `package-manager.js`, `channel_analysis.js`, `ui.js`). No stylesheet but bootstrap's
  `mobile.css` styles those classes, so a theme that skips them renders a layout the
  app's own JS believes it has already handled. Associated Stations was showing the MAC
  column stock LuCI hides, at the cost of half a row. Both class families are
  implemented now. Stock needs `!important` to win that cascade; one extra class
  (`.table .td.hide-xs`) does it here.
- **Forms on a phone zoomed the page in and never zoomed back out.** iOS Safari zooms
  when a focused control's text is smaller than 16px, and the theme's inputs are 13px.
  Below 767px they are 16px now, as in stock LuCI.
- **A stacked config row stayed one column deep whatever the rules said.** Two rules
  from elsewhere were landing on its cells. The Lua CBI gives a table cell the same
  `.cbi-value-field` class a form field carries, and base indents that class by 20px to
  sit it next to its label, so a pair-cell measured `50% + 20px`, two of them no longer
  fit a line, and each wrapped onto its own. Cell padding, meanwhile, is written as
  `.table.cbi-section-table .td`, which outranked the stack's plainer selector, so the
  stack's padding never applied at all. Both are fixed where they are written, not with
  a flag.
- The header row of a config table stayed visible on a phone and ran off the right
  edge, above a card that already repeats every one of its labels. The rule hid only
  `.thead`, which is the JS form's markup. The Lua CBI that half the third-party apps
  still render through (`luci-app-openvpn`) emits a bare `tr.cbi-section-table-titles`
  instead. Both are hidden now.

### Changed
- **Data tables on a phone stack the way stock LuCI stacks them: the column label sits
  above its value, and each cell takes half the row.** They used to put label and value
  on one line with the value flushed right, which left the value about 40% of the
  width. An Associated Stations row then spent 7 full-width lines, and its
  `.ifacebadge`, signal graph and long DUID wrapped under their own labels anyway.
  Half-width pairs fold the same row into 4 lines and hand the value the whole
  half-column. The row's buttons (Disconnect, Reserve IP) take a full-width line of
  their own below the pairs. Values stay left-aligned: a MAC, a DUID or a rate is an
  opaque string, and a ragged right edge reads worse than a ragged left one.
- **Config tables stack the same way, and a cell holding a widget keeps the full
  width.** A `.cbi-section-table` row (OpenVPN instances, firewall zones, port
  forwards) used to card into `label : value` lines with the value flushed right. It
  now uses the pair layout above: read-only cells at half a row (`data-widget` =
  dummy/flag/button, in both the `CBI.*` spelling `form.js` emits and the lowercase one
  the Lua CBI does), and any cell with an input, select or dropdown in it at the full
  width, because a dropdown half a phone wide cannot be used. Row buttons get their own
  line.
- **The width at which a data table stops being a table is stock LuCI's now, not
  ours.** Bootstrap's `mobile.css` stacks at `max-device-width: 600px`; the theme
  carded at a container width of 800px, i.e. on small tablets and narrow desktop
  windows where the real table still fits. The threshold is a 568px `#view` container:
  a 600px viewport, less the 16px of side padding `.fs-content` carries below the 767px
  tier. The DHCP-leases nowrap rule moved to the adjacent `min-width: 569px`, so no band
  of widths is left with neither behaviour.

### Performance
- **The overview showed nothing at all until its slowest section answered.** Stock
  `view.status.index` calls `poll_status()` with a `Promise.all` over every include's
  `load()`, and `render()` does not return its tree until that settles, so `#view` stays
  empty for the whole wait. Measured on the dev router (warm, in-place nav): 229 ms
  before the first section appeared, while System, CPU, Memory, Storage, DHCP and
  Network had their data at 88 ms and were held back by `29_ports` and `60_wifi`
  (180 ms each). Sections now paint as soon as their own data lands: first section
  229 → 91 ms, everything filled 243 → 191 ms.
- **The overview fetched all of its data twice on every visit.** Stock registers the
  poller only after the first load completes, and `Poll.add()` steps immediately, so the
  page re-ran every include's `load()` right after painting: roughly 250 ms of ubus work
  for data it had just fetched. An in-flight guard folds that second run into the one
  already running: 9 → 5 ubus requests per navigation.
  Both come from replacing `poll_status` from the theme's own overview include, which
  loads inside `index.load()`. That is the one window where the swap is safe (the view
  instance exists, `render()` has not been called), and it covers a full page load and
  an in-place nav alike. The section frames, the includes, their `render()` output and
  the Hide/Show toggles all stay upstream's. `fillSection()` is a transcription of
  stock's own loop, kept in the same order so it can be diffed against `index.js` when
  luci-mod-status changes. If the shape it expects is not there, the patch is skipped
  and the page runs stock.

## [0.7.16] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- The SPA router now follows `alias` and `firstchild` menu nodes, so the links
  that used to be its blind spot navigate in place like every other page:
  Firewall, System Log, Realtime Graphs, Administration, Terminal, Attended
  Sysupgrade. Those are 7 of the 27 links the menu renders — and among the most
  clicked — yet each one still did a full page reload, because the router only
  recognised `view` nodes and an alias is a redirect, not a page. Coverage over
  every clickable node goes from 50 to 62.
  Resolution is a port of `resolve_firstchild()`/`node_weight()` from
  `dispatcher.uc`, not an approximation of it: the same weight (`order ?? 9999`,
  a login node last), the same `firstchild_ineligible` and `satisfied` filters,
  the same recursion into a nested `firstchild`. It has to be exact — the server
  answers an alias URL with a 200 at that URL and resolves the leaf internally
  (no redirect), so a client that picked a different child would open one page on
  a click and another on F5. Verified against the live router: for all 65
  clickable nodes the SPA's `data-page`, `dispatchpath`, `pathinfo`, URL and tab
  strip are identical to a real full load of the same URL, in both layouts and
  across Back/Forward. `rewrite` is deliberately left alone (the tree has none,
  and a wrong guess would open the wrong page — worse than the reload it falls
  back to).
- This changelog and its Russian mirror.

### Performance
- **Every view was rendered twice on the first visit to a page, and registered two
  pollers.** LuCI's `require()` does not hand back a class — it caches an *instance*,
  so requiring a view for the first time constructs it, and a view's `__init__` *is*
  its render (that is all `ui.instantiateView()` does). The router required the view
  and then built a second instance on top, so the page was painted twice and polled at
  double the RPC rate for as long as the user stayed on it. A fresh instance is now
  built only on a revisit, when `require()` returns the singleton whose `__init__`
  already ran. Present since the router landed.
- **A view whose content comes from its first poll took up to 5 s to fill after an
  in-place navigation.** Wireless is the visible case: its station list is drawn from
  the first poll, and it sat spinning for 4950 ms against ~360 ms on a full page load.
  LuCI runs one 1 s tick and fires a poller only when `tick % interval == 0`; a full
  load calls `Poll.start()`, which zeroes the tick and steps at once, whereas the
  router kept the *outgoing* page's tick running, so the incoming view's poller had to
  wait for the next multiple of its interval. The poll loop is now put back into the
  state a fresh load leaves it in (`stop()` then `start()` on an empty queue), and the
  view's own first `poll.add()` arms the timer and takes the first step — which is
  exactly the upstream sequence, not a shortcut around it. Wireless: **4950 → 137 ms**,
  Realtime→Wireless: **55 → 16 ms**. Note `stop()` alone is not the fix and never was:
  it deletes the tick, and `Poll.add()` only auto-starts when the tick exists, so the
  page would never poll at all. Also note the two bugs above are one bug: re-arming the
  poll while the view still rendered twice made the realtime graphs throw, because
  `view/status/load.js` keeps its graph list in a module-level array (a LuCI module is
  a cached singleton across SPA navs) and indexes its RPC results by that array's
  current length — the second render grew it mid-flight. Fixing the double render
  closed that window for good.
- The navigation benchmark now covers **38 standard pages, up from 14**, compares
  **three themes** (stock `luci-theme-bootstrap`, third-party
  `luci-theme-proton2025` 1.3.0, footstrap), and all 38 pages open in footstrap
  without a page reload. Summed medians: **10517 ms bootstrap, 11680 ms proton2025,
  4638 ms footstrap**; median per-page speedup **3.43x** over bootstrap and **3.94x**
  over proton2025, and there is no longer a single page where footstrap loses. Network
  requests per navigation drop from 15–48 (bootstrap) and 27–72 (proton2025) to
  **0–8**. proton2025 is *slower* than the stock theme it restyles — it ships 436 KB
  of CSS against footstrap's 106 KB and has no client router.
  The pages the old benchmark missed are the ones the theme is fastest on: a tab or an
  alias link carries almost no work of its own, so a full reload spends its whole time
  restarting the runtime — Realtime→Wireless 287 → 16 ms (17.5x), Diagnostics 189 →
  21 ms (9.2x).
  Two harness bugs were producing plausible but false numbers and are fixed: a
  3-second wait for a spinner that a cached view never renders (it reported ~3017 ms
  for the eight *fastest* pages), and a readiness check that the outgoing page's DOM
  already satisfied. Readiness is now "the old nodes are gone", which is exactly what
  `dom.content(#view, …)` guarantees.

### Fixed
- Read-only users got working Save/Apply/Reset buttons. The SPA router rebuilt
  `L.env.nodespec` on every navigation and dropped its `readonly` flag, which
  `luci.js` reads as `hasViewPermission() = !env.nodespec.readonly`. A full page
  load disabled the buttons correctly; arriving by menu click did not.
- The active interface lost its highlight. `.ifacebox-head.active` was declared in
  `base` while `theme` repainted the plain `.ifacebox-head`, and a cascade layer
  beats specificity, so IPv4 Upstream and the radios drew as flat grey plates.
- The SSH-Keys list was capped at 440 px, wrapping a ~400-char key over three
  lines. Its `max-width: none` sat in `base` and lost the same way. Moved to
  `@layer page`, which actually wins.

### Changed
- Stylesheet deduplicated: 1.4 KB smaller, nothing rendered differently
  (`cssdiff` over nine pages). The solid buttons were written out twice, byte for
  byte, so a recolour would have landed on half of them. Twelve `base`
  declarations that a `theme` rule already repaints through a *different* selector
  are gone; `audit.py` compares identical selectors only and could not see them.
- `setOpen`, the Space key, click-outside and Escape lived in both menu files, and
  the copies had drifted: only the sidebar checked flyout mode. One implementation
  in `menu-footstrap-common.js` now, with the selector passed in. Byte-neutral
  after minification, but the two layouts can no longer disagree on what `.open`
  means.

## [0.7.15] — 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- CI never ran. A step name contained `": "`, which an unquoted YAML scalar cannot,
  so the parser read it as a nested mapping and rejected the whole workflow. Every
  run since 0.7.13 died at 0 s with no job starting.
- `build-css.sh` silently dropped a wrapped declaration. `squeeze()` joined lines
  with nothing between them, so a `calc()` spanning two source lines became a parse
  error (`…))- .004 *`). The custom property went undefined, every `var()` reading
  it turned invalid at computed-value time, and the surface fell back to `unset`: a
  white canvas at 1.5:1. The source was valid CSS, the build exited 0, the brace
  check passed. A newline now collapses like a space; existing sources build
  byte-identically.
- The tint had a flat chroma, so its strength depended on which hue you picked,
  which is the one thing an identity cue must not do. Blue and violet did nothing
  (the canvas is a blue-grey and already out-chroma'd them), warm hues shouted, and
  light mode showed nothing at all. Chroma is now a floor plus a `cos()` boost
  peaking at 258° and a warm-sector subtraction at 55°. Light gets a higher floor
  than dark, because near-white has almost no chroma of its own.
- Cats wallpaper opacity `.15` → `.20`. A tinted canvas swallowed the old value.

## [0.7.14] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- Tint slider (Appearance → *Tint (router identification)*, 0–360, 0 = off). One hue
  washes into the page canvas. `localStorage` is keyed by origin, so the hue is
  per-router with nothing server-side: the main router reads green, the AP violet,
  and a screenshot pasted into a ticket says which box it came from. The tint sets
  hue and chroma via `oklch(from …)` and leaves lightness alone. `color-mix()` was
  written first and is a trap in a polar space: the result's hue snaps to the tint's
  almost immediately, so the percentage controls nothing you can see. Both contrast
  gates sweep the tint.
- A translation catalogue. Every string was already wrapped in `_()` and `head.ut`
  already loaded LuCI's client catalogue, but `luci.mk` derives `LUCI_LANGUAGES`
  from `po/*` and there was no `po/`, so no language package was ever built and
  every `_()` fell through to its English msgid. `luci-i18n-footstrap-ru` builds
  now, and `update-po.sh --check` is a CI gate, because a translation that never
  gets compiled cannot fail loudly.

### Changed
- Derived colours and motion are named tokens. 39 inline `color-mix()`es had no
  name, and an unnamed level drifts in silence: the same hairline was 40% in one
  file and 45% in another, the same diff surface 30% in `base` and 18% in `theme`.
  The derived tier is a four-step ladder (`-soft` 12%, `-fill` 18%, `-line` 40%,
  `-line-hi` 55%), and the role × step matrix is complete on purpose. Motion went
  from seven durations and four curves to four durations and no easing token at
  all; every transition takes the CSS default.
- The `--*-color-*` export tier is a real ramp, not three aliases. `high`, `medium`
  and `low` were one token under three names, so an app asking for a gradation got
  one flat colour: `luci-app-podkop` painted its "no data" latency in the same
  vivid accent as a live value. The ramp's axis is chroma at constant lightness.
  `tools/export-tier.mjs` gates it with 256 checks and proves `high != low`,
  because a flat colour passes every contrast threshold there is.

### Fixed
- A button dropdown's chevron takes the button's own ink (`currentColor`) instead
  of `--fs-dim`. On the accent-filled Save & Apply it was grey on blue and read as
  a smudge. Form-control dropdowns keep the muted chevron on purpose.

## [0.7.13] — 2026-07-12

### Performance
- The bold mono face is gone: 20 KB fetched on every page, 30% of the font payload,
  drawing 227 elements across seven pages that were all *labels*. LuCI writes every
  status readout as `<strong>MAC:</strong> ac:1f:6b:…`, where the strong names the
  datum and the text after it is the datum. Labels take the UI face now, at zero
  cost, since Manrope 700 is already loaded. Fonts on disk 94 664 → 68 488 B; the
  CI budget ratchets down to 70 KB.

### Changed
- Tokens split into a private tier and an outbound export tier. `:root` is a shared
  global scope, and every `luci-app-*` drops its CSS into the same document
  unlayered, which outranks every cascade layer. One app writing `:root { --accent:
  … }`, or `--radius`/`--text`/`--border`, repainted this whole theme silently.
  Base reading the *conventional* names was the wider hole, since `--text-color-high`
  is a LuCI convention and an app is likelier to declare it. Measured against a
  hostile `:root` over the widget gallery: 312 of 336 elements repainted before,
  0 after. `audit.py` fails on any read of an export name from inside `styles/`.

### Removed
- The RGB colour bridge (`--accent-rgb`, `--error-color-high-rgb`, …): the HSL
  bridge's mistake in a different notation, a hand-kept second copy of a colour
  that already exists as a token. It goes stale when a palette is recoloured, and a
  missing triple makes the declaration invalid at computed-value time, so the tint
  vanishes with no error anywhere. Consumers take `color-mix()` over the token now.
- 51 dead base declarations that a later layer repaints on the same selector, found
  by a new cross-layer check in `audit.py`. The check keeps them apart from the
  absorption backlog (50 declarations where only part of a selector group is
  repainted), which must not be deleted: that would un-theme the widgets no shipped
  LuCI page renders but a third-party app does.
- 11 redundant `!important` flags (43 → 33), each checked property by property
  against the JS that writes the inline style it was supposed to fight.

## [0.7.12] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- CI gates every push and PR, not just tags. `check` needs nothing but
  `python3`/`awk`/`sh`, so it can never break the OpenWrt buildbot: shell syntax,
  the stylesheet build with its size budget, a font-byte budget, and `audit.py
  --strict` (the flag is new; the script always exited 0 and was useless as a
  gate). `lint` is npm-only and CI-only: eslint, stylelint, axe-core over the widget
  gallery across the full {light,dark} × {footstrap,hicontrast} matrix, and the
  minifier-equivalence check.
- OpenWrt 24.10 support, verified rather than assumed. The `openwrt-24.10` branch of
  `openwrt/luci` is already ucode, every template API this theme uses exists there,
  and the `L.env` blob the menu and SPA router key off is byte-identical between the
  branches. Only the package manager differs (apk vs opkg).
- `docs/18`: the peer baseline (what argon/aurora/proton2025 actually ship, measured
  from their repos), the standards checklist, and the audit this release came out of.

### Performance
- The JS is minified again (83 → 35 KB). `LUCI_MINIFY_JS:=0` had been copied from
  the CSS side, where it is justified, since csstidy mangles `:has()`/`color-mix()`.
  But `luci.mk` minifies JS with jsmin, which is already on the buildbot, and uhttpd
  serves `/www` uncompressed, so those were wire bytes and flash bytes both.
  Comments stay in git. jsmin's hazard is real and silent: it tells a regex from a
  division by one preceding character, and can swallow the rest of a file while
  exiting 0. So `wrap-regex` forbids the shape and `tools/jsmin-verify.mjs` proves
  the output is token-identical to the source.
- `build-css.sh` squeezes the whitespace CSS ignores (117.5 → 108.3 KB), proven
  behaviour-neutral with `cssdiff` over ~4000 elements.

### Security
- The self-update script's state moved out of `/tmp` into root-owned
  `/var/run/footstrap-update`. `/tmp` is 1777 and the old paths were predictable, so
  a local user could pre-create them as symlinks and make root's `cp`, `chmod`,
  `curl -o` and `>` write through to a file of their choosing (CWE-377). `PATH` is
  pinned, since rpcd lets the caller pass env. Both `curl` calls gained timeouts, and
  a truncated cache no longer wedges the update button until reboot.

### Fixed
- Accessibility, up to WCAG 2.2 AA. Buttons had no focus indicator at all: base
  listed `button:hover`, not `:focus`, and the theme layer erased what was left. One
  global `--on-accent: #fff` sat on every fill in every mode and measured 1.69:1 on
  dark palettes' light fills; it is four inks now, defined per palette and per mode.
  The "hicontrast" palette was less contrasty than the default. Chips had a systemic
  bug: text of colour C on a translucent tint of C eats its own contrast, and being
  translucent its value depends on the surface underneath, so no percentage is safe
  everywhere. Plus `prefers-reduced-motion`, `forced-colors`, the W3C APG disclosure
  pattern for menus, a `<nav>` landmark, a skip link, an `<h1>` and 24 px touch
  targets.
- `fs-select.js` leaked a listener per option-list rebuild. All three
  MutationObservers ran a full scan on every poll tick, forcing layout. `data-page`
  was stamped from the *request* path, so `/admin/status` produced `admin-status` and
  every page-scoped rule silently missed. A self-update RPC in flight could outlive a
  navigation and throw a modal onto an unrelated page.
- The `PKG_UPGRADE` install guard was dead in production. apk never sets it, so only
  `dev-sync.sh` ever took the upgrade branch. A marker file decides fresh install vs
  upgrade now.

## [0.7.11] — 2026-07-12

### Changed
- The HSL component bridge is gone. Every base shadow and hairline that read
  `--*-hsl` / `--*-h/s/l` uses `color-mix()` over the real palette tokens, so a
  palette edit repaints them with no hand-synced copy. The native select chevron is
  a per-palette data-URI (a data-URI cannot read `var()`), so it follows palette and
  mode.
- The header and footer chrome is shared between both layouts. Brand, appearance
  button, logout, notices and the whole footer were written twice and had drifted;
  they live in `themes/footstrap/partials/` now. The page title goes through
  `striptags()`, because a third-party menu title is not trusted markup.

### Fixed
- `ui.Select.setValue()` rewrites the native select without dispatching `change`, so
  the enhanced widget went stale: it showed the old value while Save read the new one.
- A missing `#tabmenu`/`#modemenu` no longer rejects out of `ui.menu.load()` and kills
  every menu. SPA navigation carries a generation token, so a slow view can no longer
  render into `#view` on top of a newer one.
- `luci.mk` keys `Build/Prepare` on `LUCI_NAME`, which defaults to the checkout
  directory name, so a differently-named checkout silently skipped the CSS build.
  Pinned.
- `postrm` moves an active footstrap `mediaurlbase` back to `bootstrap` instead of
  leaning on LuCI's runtime fallback.

### Added
- Bilingual GitHub issue forms. The bug form asks for what a layout bug cannot be
  reproduced without: theme version, board, layout, palette/mode, page path, viewport,
  and whether stock `luci-theme-bootstrap` shows it too.

## [0.7.10] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- `appearance: base-select` is scoped to LuCI form selects only (issue #2).
  Third-party app selects, such as podkop-plus's connection-monitor filter, sit
  outside `.cbi-value-field` and populate options via `replaceChildren`. Forcing
  `base-select` on every select made them render Chrome's customizable `::picker`,
  which early Chrome builds mis-render, showing only the first option. App selects
  fall back to a themed closed control plus the native, reliable dropdown list.

## [0.7.9] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- The apk Software page stacks on phones. It injects an unlayered inline `<style>`
  (`.controls{display:flex}`) that no cascade layer can outrank, so the
  Filter/Download/Actions columns crammed side by side and their labels overlapped.
  The disk-space bar's value drops below the bar with reserved space, so the long
  "N MiB used of …" no longer collides with the label.

## [0.7.8] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- One seam-free wallpaper layer per layout. Top-nav painted the cats on both
  `.fs-topwrap` and its `.fs-main-top` child, so two semi-transparent tile layers
  doubled and misaligned. The denser new art made the seam obvious.
- An empty data table renders cleanly. `L.ui.Table`'s single-cell placeholder row
  spanned only the first column in a `display:table` table, and the corner rounding
  drew a tiny box.

## [0.7.7] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- New cats artwork (`docs/design/cats_final3.svg` is the editable source), recoloured
  to the theme's neutral and slightly denser (tile 520 → 440 px).

## [0.7.6] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Standard breakpoints: mobile ≤767, tablet 768–1199, desktop ≥1200, remapped
  everywhere including the flyout-mode JS breakpoint. The overview grid moved from a
  viewport `@media` to a robust `@container`, and the content column cap goes
  1040 → 1280.
- The Port status cards on the overview are count-agnostic (`auto-fit
  minmax(126,200)`, so 2 to 24+ ports lay out without a card stretching full-width),
  with a per-card container query that stacks speed and traffic when a card is too
  narrow.

### Fixed
- A long DHCP hostname wraps instead of forcing the table wide.
- Config-form modals widen to `min(1100px, 94vw)` via `.modal:has(.cbi-map)`, so a
  table inside (Bridge VLAN filtering) shows as a real table on desktop instead of
  cards.

## [0.7.5] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Palettes are swappable variant blocks, one self-contained block per colourway ×
  light/dark in `styles/03-palettes.css`. Adding a colourway is copying a block. Zero
  render change.
- The sidebar's redundant page-title topbar is gone, and `#indicators` moves to the
  top of the sidebar (a spinning glyph on the collapsed rail).
- Data tables reflow to fit the content column instead of scrolling horizontally.

### Fixed
- Top-nav on phones: Log out becomes an icon button, and `stripFitsOneRow` ignores the
  hidden item, so the menu still shrinks to one row.
- `.cbi-value` stacks on phones, so a field's help text gets the full column instead of
  an 8-line crush.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- Rounding slider (Appearance, 0–20 px). One user base radius drives the whole scale
  proportionally, and 76 literal radii across 15 files became tokens. `head.ut`
  pre-paints it before first paint, so a reload never flashes the old radius.

### Fixed
- System → Administration → SSH-Keys renders its whole view as a bare `<div>` with no
  `.cbi-section`, so on the wallpaper the text sat frameless. It gets the panel card.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- Phantom scroll on every tabbed form (Network → DNS/Interfaces/DHCP, Firewall, Flash).
  Inactive tab panes were collapsed to `height:0; overflow:hidden`, but a
  clipped-content pane still inflates `scrollHeight`, and DNS scrolled 792 px into
  blank space below the footer. The old `display:none` fix only matched `.cbi-section`
  panes, and dnsmasq renders each tab as a plain `<div data-tab-title>`.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- Appearance popover: Wallpaper group (Off/Cats), palette reduced to 2
  (footstrap/hicontrast), Submenus and Updates toggles restored.
- Tabs and top-nav auto-fit. JS measures the wrap and applies density classes,
  trimming padding first and font last, with a text floor.

### Changed
- Data tables get a whole-table contour with rounded corners, and any direct parent in
  `#view` scrolls, so a table never pokes past its section.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- The release check caches for 5 minutes, not an hour. The TTL is exactly how long a
  freshly published release stays invisible in the popover, and an hour made a stale
  badge indistinguishable from a broken check. At 300 s the worst case is 12 API
  calls/hour, well inside GitHub's anonymous budget.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- The styles tree is one directory per cascade layer (`tokens, base, theme, page`),
  with the 2300-line base stylesheet split by component. Rule order inside each layer
  is unchanged, and `cssdiff` reports zero computed-style differences on both layouts.
- The changelog-shaped duplication is collapsed. 182 declarations were shadowed by a
  later rule on the same selector, 108 of them restating an identical value. Tabs were
  described twice, the base button three times, the open dropdown list five times. Two
  of those duplicates were load-bearing through source order alone, and now win on
  specificity instead of position. Minified output 116 → 110 KB.
- The last of the bootstrap heritage is gone. The 28 hardcoded colours left in base are
  tokens (`.close` rendered `#000` on a dark background), `common.bootstrap()` became
  `common.init()`, and the word is out of filenames and comments. The Apache-2.0
  attribution in the banner stays, being a licence obligation rather than a description.

### Removed
- The four legacy `-dark`/`-light` media and template symlinks per layout.
  `uci-defaults` migrates a stale `mediaurlbase` before the on-disk check runs, so they
  guarded nothing.

### Added
- `audit.py` checks for declarations shadowed within a layer, so the stylesheet cannot
  drift back into a changelog.

---

Everything below 0.7.0 predates this file and is summarised one section per minor
line, not one per tag. The individual patch releases are in the git history.

## [0.6.x] — 2026-07-09 … 07-10

### Added
- The theme version in the Appearance popover, an update badge when a newer GitHub
  release exists, and one-click self-update. The backend is an ACL-gated `file.exec`
  of one fixed path with no arguments, installing with apk on 25.12 or opkg on 24.10.
- An Updates toggle (Check/Off). Off skips the GitHub call entirely: no fetch, no
  badge, no button.

### Changed
- The release check moved off the browser and onto the router. A LAN client often has
  no route to the internet while the router does, and GitHub allows 60 anonymous calls
  per hour per IP, which a check on every page load burned through.
- Self-update runs detached. `rpc.js` aborts the XHR after 20 s and rpcd kills the
  exec'd process after 30 s, so a synchronous install could not fit and rpcd could kill
  apk mid-install. The script spawns a worker and the client polls `status`.

### Fixed
- Self-update reported failure when it had succeeded. `postinst` restarts rpcd, which
  drops the session, so the status poll died with "Login session is expired". That is
  the success path, and it says so now, with a Log in again button.
- The dropdown chevron had no hit area. `font-size: 0`, which hides the stock textual
  arrow, also collapsed the inherited `line-height`, so the span measured 28×0 while
  the chevron rendered outside it. Aiming at the visible chevron hit the button behind
  it, and on Diagnostics that started a ping. Now 34×30.
- Widget tables lost their rounded frame. A real `<table>` inherits `border-collapse:
  collapse`, which ignores `border-radius`, and the corners had come from an
  `overflow: hidden` that was dropped so an open dropdown would not be clipped.
  Switched to the separated border model with zero spacing: same layout, radius applies.
- The sidebar rail was gated at min-width 901 px while the mobile bar moved to 600, so
  between 601 and 900 the collapse button set `data-rail` with no rule to match it.
- A progressbar's value overlapped the row divider in multi-column tables
  (cpu-status "Detailed load of each CPU").

## [0.5.x] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- Collapsible sidebar rail (`data-rail`, persisted, applied before paint). Section
  submenus become hover/tap flyouts and leaves get a tooltip.
- Below 900 px the sidebar becomes the same sticky, blurred bar the top-nav layout uses.
- A Submenus switch in Appearance (sidebar only): Keep open, or Auto-collapse.

### Changed
- The custom overview dashboard is retired. `05_footstrap_dashboard.js` re-rendered a
  page-tall tree on every poll, which flickered and reset mobile scroll. A layout-only
  include replaces it: it tags the stock System/Memory/Storage sections and wraps them
  in a grid, leaving stock content and polling untouched.
- Every progressbar collapsed into one thin 10 px meter with the value above its right
  edge. Memory, Storage, CPU load, Active Connections and the Software disk bar all
  render identically now.
- The page heading and every tab strip sit in a rounded card.

### Fixed
- Login was a blank page. The forked `sysauth.ut` parked the form in a
  `<section hidden>` and revealed it from a view module, but there is no session on the
  login page, an RPC in that chain answers Access denied, and `render()` never ran. The
  card is rendered server-side now, with no JS at all.
- Keep-open sections survive a full page load, not just an SPA nav. The set lives in
  `localStorage` (`fs-menu-open`).
- Inactive CBI tab panes are taken out of flow. A `height:0; overflow:hidden` pane still
  inflates `scrollHeight`, which added ~585 px of phantom scroll below the footer.
- The sidebar-to-top-bar breakpoint dropped from 850 to 600 px, so the sidebar stays
  usable on narrow tablets.
- `form.TableSection`/`GridSection` render their table without an id, so the key/value
  rules were forcing `width: 40%` and `nowrap` on the first column and starving the
  data columns.

## [0.4.x] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- A client-side SPA router. A menu click re-instantiates the target LuCI view in place
  instead of reloading the page: no re-parse of `luci.js`/`cbi.js`, no re-fetched
  translations, no menu rebuild. It covers `view` nodes (~89% of pages), and
  call/function/template/alias nodes, external links, downloads, modified clicks and
  any error fall back to normal navigation. `pushState` keeps real dispatcher URLs, so
  F5, deep links and back/forward still work.
- A Playwright navigation benchmark against stock bootstrap: median 2.28× faster
  click-to-render, 1.91× total, and 15–39 requests per page down to 1–4 (`docs/15`).
- The uci changes modal is themed: token-based diff tints instead of the vivid stock
  colours, rounded to match the cards.

## [0.3.x] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- The GitHub Primer palette becomes the default `footstrap`; the previous high-contrast
  look stays selectable as Hi-Contrast.
- The cats wallpaper, shipped self-hosted, first as the Roman palette and then renamed
  Rvht (the legacy value migrates client-side before paint).
- CI builds an ipk for 24.10 alongside the apk for 25.12, and `install.sh` detects apk
  vs opkg and fetches the matching asset.

### Changed
- Six theme entries collapse to two layouts, FootstrapSidebar and FootstrapOnTop. Mode
  and palette became client-side toggles, and `uci-defaults` migrates existing installs
  onto their base layout.
- Standalone data tables (leases, Processes, Startup, Associated Stations) stack into
  cards below 820 px. They carry no `.cbi-map` wrapper, so the section-table container
  query never reached them and they overflowed to ~800 px on a phone.
- `postinst` and `postrm` restart rpcd, so a direct apk/opkg install picks up the ACLs
  and the theme registration without a reboot.

### Fixed
- Top-nav dropdowns work on touch. Hover-only submenus were unusable there: a tap now
  toggles a popup card below the bar, a second tap closes it, and on a hybrid device a
  real mouse entering the menu drops the tap-opened panel.
- The firewall zone table stacks through container queries instead of overflowing.

## [0.2.x] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- The Appearance popover (Mode auto/light/dark, plus Palette), replacing the plain dark
  toggle. Client-side, instant, persisted, no reload.

### Fixed
- Saving a wireless config, or any form with a native select, failed silently.
  `fs-select` rendered its styled dropdown *before* the native `<select>`, making the
  dropdown `frameEl.firstChild`, and `ui.Select.getValue()` reads
  `this.node.firstChild.value`. It got a `<div>` and returned undefined. The dropdown
  goes after the select now, with the value mirrored both ways.
- Inactive tab panes showed a ~38 px phantom strip on first render. LuCI sets
  `data-tab-active="true"` on the shown tab only, and the others carry no attribute yet,
  so a rule keyed on `"false"` missed them.
- The duplicate-hide MutationObserver was installed once per poll, leaking observers and
  slowing the page progressively.
- The `--faint` token (table headers, field labels) was used but never declared.
- The Enabled button on System → Startup was blue text on a green fill.

## [0.1.x] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- First release. `luci-theme-footstrap` for OpenWrt 25.12+: two layouts, a ucode-only
  server shell, and an apk build through the OpenWrt SDK.

### Fixed
- LuCI's CSS and JS minifiers are disabled. csstidy mangles `:has()`, `color-mix()` and
  nested `calc()`, which broke the layout outright. JS minification came back in 0.7.12,
  once jsmin was proven safe by a token-equivalence gate.
