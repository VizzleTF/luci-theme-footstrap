# Hand netifd the address docker has ALREADY put on eth0 — and do it BEFORE procd boots.
#
# THE TIMING IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is why this is not a uci-defaults script.
# Two things happen during OpenWrt's boot that a container does not survive by default:
#
#   1. By the time /etc/uci-defaults/* run, eth0 is DOWN and FLUSHED (measured: at that
#      point `ip addr` shows `eth0@if49: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> state DOWN` with no
#      inet at all). So a uci-default cannot read the address docker assigned — it reads
#      nothing, and every "derive the config from the live interface" idea has to run out
#      here, before `exec /sbin/init`.
#   2. `/bin/config_generate` then writes a config of its own from /etc/board.json, and on
#      x86 that means `br-lan` with eth0 enslaved and a hardcoded 192.168.1.1. netifd
#      applies it, docker's address is gone, and the container is unreachable with no
#      console to fix it from. That is not a theory — it is what the first version of this
#      setup did.
#
# config_generate's own guard is `[ -s /etc/config/network -a -s /etc/config/system ] &&
# exit 0`, so writing BOTH files here is what stops it. Hence /etc/config/system is
# shipped in the image even though nothing about it is interesting: an empty or missing
# one re-arms the generator.
#
# The values are DERIVED from the interface rather than passed in from compose, because a
# copy in compose is the copy nobody remembers to change. And because they match what is
# already on the wire, netifd re-asserting them is a no-op.

# linked/unlinked variants, the per-port zone colour. Issue #15 (a fork drawing its tiles half
# their track) lived exactly there and could not be reproduced on a one-port box.
#
# THREE constraints decide the shape below, and each was measured on the box:
#   * `veth`, NOT `dummy`. The port list comes from `ubus call luci getBuiltinEthernetPorts`,
#     which on x86 keeps a device only if netifd reports `devtype` `ethernet`/`dsa` — and netifd
#     reports NO devtype at all for a dummy (checked: `network.device status` gives eth1-as-dummy
#     `present`/`up`/`carrier` and nothing else), so a dummy is invisible to that card however it
#     is named or configured.
#   * named `ethN`, because the same filter also wants `link-advertising` OR a name matching
#     `^eth\d+$`, and a veth advertises nothing.
#   * eth3's PEER is left down: carrier follows the peer, so that pair is the "no link" tile
#     (hollow dot, dimmed name, port_down.svg) beside two linked ones.
# They carry no network and appear in no uci config — the card reads the device list, not config.
