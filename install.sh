#
# One package, translations included: the theme carries its own .lmo catalogue.

# --- downloader -----------------------------------------------------------
# Prefer tools that speak HTTPS on OpenWrt; fall back through what's present.
# $1 = url, $2 = output file (omit for stdout).
#
# EVERY fetch below VERIFIES THE CERTIFICATE. This script is piped from the
# internet into `sh` as root and the thing it downloads is installed as a root
# package, so the TLS channel is the entire trust chain (together with the sha256
# check further down). It used to retry with `--no-check-certificate` / `-k` after
# ANY failure of the verified attempt — which includes a MITM presenting a bogus
# cert — and the "install the CA bundle" hint below was therefore unreachable in
# the one case it was written for. `ca-bundle` is in OpenWrt's DEFAULT_PACKAGES,
# so the insecure path bought nothing on a stock router and silently disarmed the
# check on a broken one. Do not add a `-k` fallback back.
# fetch <url> <max-seconds> [outfile]  — stdout when no outfile.
# Same signature as footstrap-selfupdate.sh's fetch(), deliberately: the two are mirrors of
# each other (see the @mirror note below) and a differing signature is how they drifted in the
# first place — this one used to take (url, outfile), hardcode --max-time on the curl branch
# and give uclient-fetch, its FIRST choice on OpenWrt, no timeout at all.
# Last resort in the chain below is wget, effectively the non-OpenWrt path (an OpenWrt box has
# uclient-fetch, and its /usr/bin/wget is usually the same applet). GNU wget follows an
# https -> http redirect by default, so ask for --https-only where it exists; a wget without
# the flag is busybox's, which we would not have reached on the boxes that ship one.

# There is exactly ONE package, and the translation catalogue rides inside it. v0.8.4 shipped
# the catalogue as a separate luci-i18n-footstrap-<lang> package and that broke the update
# button on every router already in the field — see the long note in the package Makefile.
# The release must stay pickable by the self-updater the router ALREADY runs, and that one
# takes the first asset of its extension; so a release carries one asset per format.

# --- download, verify, install --------------------------------------------
# Each package is installed as root with --allow-untrusted, i.e. with no package signature
# to fall back on — so the sha256 the API publishes for the asset is the only integrity
# check there is. It comes over the same TLS channel as the URL, so it does not defend
# against a compromised api.github.com; what it does defend against is a truncated or
# tampered download from the asset CDN, which is a different host.
#
# A missing digest is therefore a REFUSAL, not a warning. Half of a two-link trust chain
# cannot be optional: whatever makes the digest empty — GitHub renaming the field, the API
# answer not being what we think it is — leaves us installing bytes we cannot account for,
# and printing a line about it into a `curl | sh` scroll changes nothing about that. Set
# FOOTSTRAP_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=1 to override; it is deliberately something you have to type.
