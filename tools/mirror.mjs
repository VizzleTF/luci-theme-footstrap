/* @mirror — enforce that duplication you cannot delete is duplication that cannot ROT.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Some duplication in this project is forced by the language, not chosen:
 *
 *   - CSS cannot share a declaration block across two mutually-exclusive guards. The card
 *     layout for a stacked table is needed under a CLASS (.fs-stacked, the measured data
 *     table) and under a CONTAINER QUERY (the config table, which cannot be measured — see
 *     fs-select.js). No selector ORs those, so the block is written twice.
 *   - `install.sh` is fetched with `curl | sh` and runs BEFORE the package exists, so it
 *     cannot `source` a library that ships inside the package. Yet it must do exactly what
 *     `footstrap-selfupdate.sh` does: fetch over a verified channel, pin the asset host,
 *     check the sha256. So those blocks are written twice too.
 *
 * The trap — and the whole reason for this tool — is that a STRUCTURAL duplicate detector
 * (tools/css-dup.mjs) finds bodies that are IDENTICAL. The moment two copies diverge they
 * stop being a "duplicate" and the detector goes QUIET — exactly when you need it to shout.
 * That is not hypothetical: `fetch()` in install.sh and footstrap-selfupdate.sh had already
 * drifted three ways (different backend order, one with no timeout on its first-choice tool,
 * one missing the https redirect pin) and nothing said a word.
 *
 * So: tag every copy, and this asserts they stay byte-identical.
 *
 *   shell / JS:   # @mirror <group>/<role>      …lines…      # @endmirror
 *   CSS:          /* @mirror <group>/<role> *\/  …rule…      /* @endmirror *\/
 *
 * Comparison ignores the common leading indentation and trailing whitespace, so the same
 * block may sit at a different nesting depth in each file. EVERYTHING else must match.
 *
 * A group/role with only ONE copy is an error too: a mirror of one is a tag someone forgot to
 * delete when the other copy died, and it would silently accept any future edit.

 *
 * The Apache-2.0 text has to exist twice and neither copy can go:
 *   LICENSE                        — the repo root, which is the only place GitHub looks
 *   luci-theme-footstrap/LICENSE   — the PACKAGE, because PKG_LICENSE_FILES resolves against
 *                                    $(PKG_BUILD_DIR) and luci.mk copies only
 *                                    src/ luasrc/ htdocs/ root/ ucode/ po/ into it; CI rsyncs
 *                                    only the package dir into the SDK, so the root file is not
 *                                    reachable from $(CURDIR) either.
 * A licence text cannot carry an @mirror comment without ceasing to be the licence text, so it
 * is pinned as a whole file instead. */
