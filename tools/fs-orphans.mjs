/* Dead-selector check, scoped to the theme's OWN namespace — the scoping is the whole point.
 *
 * PurgeCSS/uncss/coverage-pruning are ACTIVELY DANGEROUS here. CLAUDE.md: "never drop the styling
 * of a selector because no shipped LuCI page uses it." Content is rendered by third-party
 * luci-app-* JS, so a `.cbi-*` selector with no example on this router is still styled for the
 * package that emits it on someone else's — anything pruning what it did not SEE rendered
 * un-themes other people's apps. We never ask "was this rule exercised".
 *
 * `.fs-*` is OURS: only this theme's templates and JS can emit one. So inside that namespace, and
 * only there, "nothing we ship emits this class" really does mean dead. Every LuCI/cbi class is
 * ignored on purpose — that is the set the contract protects.
 *
 *   FORWARD  — styled but never emitted: left behind when markup is deleted (would have caught
 *              .fs-topnav/.fs-mainmenu when the top-nav template went).
 *   REVERSE  — emitted but never styled: dead markup, a typo, or something riding on inherited
 *              base styles by accident.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/fs-orphans.mjs
