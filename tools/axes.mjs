/* Every Appearance axis (dark mode, palette, wallpaper, rounding, tint, accent, rail, layout) is
 * implemented TWICE, and nothing held the copies together:
 *
 *   1. `partials/head.ut` — inline <script>s that read localStorage and stamp :root BEFORE THE
 *      FIRST PAINT, or the page flashes the wrong theme on every reload. They cannot `require` a
 *      LuCI module: the module loader does not exist yet.
 *   2. `fs-prefs.js` — the live appliers behind the Appearance popover. (The update-check control is
 *      NOT one of these: it is not pre-painted, and it lives in the optional updater package, not the
 *      theme tree this gate scans.)
 *
 * Forced duplication, like the @mirror cases — but these two can never be byte-identical (inline
 * script vs module), so mirror.mjs cannot hold them. What CAN be held is the CONTRACT: key names,
 * :root attributes, custom properties, valid ranges, the default — and the load-bearing rule:
 *
 *      set the custom property BEFORE the attribute that switches the mixes on,
 *      or a fresh load paints one frame with the previous hue.
 *
 * The contract is DERIVED FROM THE JS, not restated here a third time: read the axes out of the
 * theme's resource modules, then hold head.ut (plus the CSS token and fs-orphans' ignore list) to
 * them. Add an axis and the gate tells you what you forgot.
 *
 * The JS side is the WHOLE resources tree concatenated, deliberately: it used to name one file, and
 * an axis moved (or added) elsewhere would have left the gate quietly checking nothing. A glob
 * cannot go stale that way.

 * the first version of this check did, and it failed on `data-rail` — which is correct code. The
 * pre-paint runs on a FRESH document where :root carries nothing but what the SERVER wrote (only
 * `data-layout`), so there is never a stale attribute to clear; an axis whose off-state is a deleted
 * key (applyRail lsDel's) simply falls through its `if` and is already right. The removals the other
