/* Every Appearance axis (dark mode, palette, wallpaper, rounding, tint, accent, rail, layout) is
 * implemented TWICE, and nothing held the copies together:
 *
 *   1. `partials/head.ut` — inline <script>s that read localStorage and stamp :root BEFORE THE
 *      FIRST PAINT, or the page flashes the wrong theme on every reload. They cannot `require` a
 *      LuCI module: the module loader does not exist yet.
 *   2. `fs-prefs.js` (+ `fs-update.js` for the update-check axis) — the live appliers behind the
 *      Appearance popover.
 *
 * Forced duplication, like the @mirror cases — but these two can never be byte-identical (inline
 * script vs module), so mirror.mjs cannot hold them. What CAN be held is the CONTRACT: key names,
 * :root attributes, custom properties, valid ranges, the default — and the load-bearing rule:
 *
 *      set the custom property BEFORE the attribute that switches the mixes on,
 *      or a fresh load paints one frame with the previous hue.
 *
 * The contract is DERIVED FROM THE JS, not restated here a third time: read the axes out of the
 * theme's resource modules, then hold head.ut (plus the CSS token and fs-orphans' ignore list) to
 * them. Add an axis and the gate tells you what you forgot.
 *
 * The JS side is the WHOLE resources tree concatenated, deliberately: it used to name one file, and
 * an axis moved (or added) elsewhere would have left the gate quietly checking nothing. A glob
 * cannot go stale that way.
